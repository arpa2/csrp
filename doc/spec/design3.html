<h1>SRP-3 Protocol Design</h1>
SRP-3 was the protocol
<a href="ftp://srp.stanford.edu/pub/srp/srp.ps">published in 1998</a>
and described in RFC2945.
It solved the security problems of <a href="design1.html">SRP-1</a> and
<a href="design2.html">SRP-2</a>,
and is still widely used.
It suffers from the "two-for-one" password guessing attack,
and requires the server to wait for one of the client's
messages before sending its own.
Both these issues have been addressed by <a href="design.html">SRP-6</a>,
which is recommended for new applications.
<pre>
  N    A large safe prime (N = 2q+1, where q is prime)
       All arithmetic is done modulo N.
  g    A generator modulo N
  s    User's salt
  U    Username
  p    Cleartext Password
  H()  One-way hash function
  ^    (Modular) Exponentiation
  t    Security parameter
  u    Random scrambling parameter
  a,b  Secret ephemeral values
  A,B  Public ephemeral values
  x    Private key (derived from p and s)
  v    Password verifier
</pre>

The host stores passwords using the following formula:

<pre>
  x = H(s, p)               (s is chosen randomly)
  v = g^x                   (computes password verifier)
</pre>

The host then keeps {U, s, v} in its password database.

The authentication protocol itself goes as follows:

<pre>
User -> Host:  U, A = g^a                  (identifies self, a = random number)
Host -> User:  s, B = v + g^b, u           (sends salt, b = random number,
                                            u = t-bit random number)

        User:  x = H(s, p)                 (user enters password)
        User:  S = (B - g^x) ^ (a + ux)    (computes session key)
        User:  K = H(S)

        Host:  S = (Av^u) ^ b              (computes session key)
        Host:  K = H(S)
</pre>

Now the two parties have a shared, strong session key K.  To complete
authentication, they need to prove to each other that their keys match.
One possible way:

<pre>
User -> Host:  M = H(H(N) xor H(g), H(U), s, A, B, K)
Host -> User:  H(A, M, K)
</pre>

The two parties also employ the following safeguards:
<ol>
<li>The user will abort if he receives B == 0 (mod N) or u == 0.
<li>The host will abort if it detects that A == 0 (mod N).
<li>The user must show his proof of K first.  If the server detects that
the user's proof is incorrect, it must abort without showing its own
proof of K.
</ol>
